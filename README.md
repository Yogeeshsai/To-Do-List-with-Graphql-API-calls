#Creating a project like this involves several components including setting up a Flask web application, integrating Keycloak for authentication, implementing GraphQL API for CRUD operations, integrating Stripe for #payments, and handling image uploads. Below, I'll provide an outline of the steps you'll need to take and some sample code snippets to get you started.

#Step 1: Set Up Flask Web Application
#First, create a Flask application and set up the necessary routes and configurations.
#python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

#Step 2: Integrate Keycloak for Authentication
#Follow the Keycloak documentation to set up Keycloak and integrate it with your Flask application for authentication.

#Step 3: Implement GraphQL API
#Install Flask-GraphQL and Graphene libraries for implementing GraphQL API.
#Bash
pip install Flask-GraphQL graphene
#Python
from flask_graphql import GraphQLView
import graphene

class Todo(graphene.ObjectType):
    id = graphene.ID()
    title = graphene.String()
    description = graphene.String()
    time = graphene.DateTime()

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    todos = graphene.List(Todo)

  def resolve_todos(self, info):
        #Implement logic to fetch todos from the database
        pass

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)

app.add_url_rule('/graphql', view_func=GraphQLView.as_view('graphql', schema=schema, graphiql=True))
