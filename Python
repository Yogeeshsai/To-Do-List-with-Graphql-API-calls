Step 1: Set Up Flask Application
python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Step 2: Integrate Keycloak for Authentication
Follow the Keycloak documentation to set up Keycloak and integrate it with your Flask application for authentication.

Step 3: Implement GraphQL API
Install Flask-GraphQL and Graphene libraries for implementing GraphQL API.

bash

pip install Flask-GraphQL graphene
python

from flask_graphql import GraphQLView
import graphene

class Todo(graphene.ObjectType):
    id = graphene.ID()
    title = graphene.String()
    description = graphene.String()
    time = graphene.DateTime()

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    todos = graphene.List(Todo)

    def resolve_todos(self, info):
        # Implement logic to fetch todos from the database
        pass

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)

app.add_url_rule('/graphql', view_func=GraphQLView.as_view('graphql', schema=schema, graphiql=True))
Step 4: Integrate Stripe for Payments
Follow the Stripe documentation to integrate Stripe for payments.

Step 5: Handle Image Uploads
Implement image uploads for users with a Pro license. You can use Flask-Uploads for handling file uploads.

Step 6: UI Development
Develop a basic UI using HTML, CSS, and optionally React for frontend interactions.

Step 7: Deployment
Deploy your Flask application to a server. You can use Docker for containerization.

Sample Dockerfile
Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "app.py" ]
Sample requirements.txt
Flask
Flask-GraphQL
graphene
This is a high-level overview, and you'll need to dive deeper into each step, implementing authentication, GraphQL API, Stripe integration, and image uploads. Also, make sure to handle errors, validations, and security measures appropriately.
